\subsubsection*{Leap year algorithm explained}
Figure \ref{fig:FlowLeapYear} shows a flowchart of the algorithm. It starts with the user input and then goes through a maximum of three if statements to test whether or not it is a leap year. It starts by evaluating if the input is lower than 1582 because then it is not a leap year and it returns false. If it is greater then it might be a leap year and it continues to evaluate if it is divisible by 100 and 400. If yes then it is a leap year and it returns true. If not then it can still be a leap year of it is divisible by 4 and not 100 and will then return true otherwise false and the algorithm is done.
